      <h2>Selected Work</h2>

      <!-- project 1 -->

        <h3>Balsa Wood Truss Bridge</h3>
            <img src="public copy/Bridge.jpeg" alt="Balsa wood truss bridge" width="300">
        <p>
          A balsa wood truss bridge designed to efficiently carry load through a truss structure. Built entirely from balsa wood and engineered for strength-to-weight performance. This project won first place at the Freshman Engineering Expo.

        <h3>Pointillism Drawing</h3>
<img src="public copy/d2.jpeg" alt="Pointillism drawing with layered faces, flowers, and shadows" width="300">
        <p>
          I have been drawing for as long as I can remember, and for a few years I became deeply focused on pointillism and long hours of stippling. The process forced patience, as each image had to be built one mark at a time with no shortcuts.
        </p>
        <p>
          That slowness is what kept me invested. The work felt quiet, focused, and almost meditative. This piece emerged from that period, with faces, flowers, and shadows layered until they blur together. It was not about meaning, but about density and time spent with the drawing until it became heavy in its own way.

      <!-- project 3 -->
      <article>
        <h3>Survivor Arena Game</h3>
<img src="public copy/g1.jpeg" alt="Survivor Arena top-down survival game screenshot" width="300">
        <p>
          Survivor Arena started as a simple “what if I just made a game?” moment and quickly turned into a chaotic top-down survival experience. You dodge swarms, auto-shoot enemies, collect drops, and stack upgrades until the difficulty becomes unfair.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is messy, fast, and intentionally simple — very much a product of boredom on a rainy day that turned into a fully built experiment.

      <!-- project 4 -->
      <article>
        <h3>3D Modeled Energy Drink</h3>
<img src="public copy/m1.jpeg" alt="3D modeled energy drink can exploring form and branding" width="300">
        <p>
          A 3D modeled energy drink concept exploring form, materials, and branding presence. This project focused on translating graphic identity into a believable physical object.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- project 5 -->
      <article>
        <h3>Packaging Die Cut | Mango Energy Drink</h3>
<img src="public copy/m2.jpeg" alt="Packaging die cut layout for mango energy drink multi-pack" width="300">
        <p>
          Die cut layout and packaging structure exploration for a branded multi-pack concept. This piece examines how flat layouts translate into physical packaging systems.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- project 6 -->
      <article>
        <h3>Graphic Art Generated from 3D Model</h3>
<img src="public copy/m3.jpeg" alt="Graphic art derived from 3D model shapes and contours" width="300">
        <p>
          Graphic art experimentation derived from the shapes and contours of the 3D model. This project explores how dimensional form can inform visual texture and composition.
