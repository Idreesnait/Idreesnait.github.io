    <h2>Interdisciplinary Creative Technologist</h2>

<p>
    I am a third-year Creative Technology and Design student in the School of 
    Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
</p>
<p>
    I grew up in Qatar, surrounded by a culture driven to build a future that 
    is equally functional and beautiful. That environment shaped how I see design, 
    not as decoration, but as a system that should work, feel intentional, and invite people’s interest.
</p>

    <p>
        I began as a fine artist, drawn not just to visuals but to interaction; how 
        things respond, behave, and evolve. My work has evolved into a comfort with the
         strange, refining obsessive curiosity into a focused and creative workflow.

    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      Design is a progressive act. It questions norms, embraces
      experimentation, and proposes futures that are better than where they
      began. I believe the strongest work balances clarity with mystery. It
      should be buildable, functional, replicable, and occasionally a little
      strange.
